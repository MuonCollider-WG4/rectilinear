Folder 'varying_RF_length' is the previous version in which the RF length varies in each stage. 

Folder 'fixed_RF_length' is the version in which the RF length is fixed for each frequency. (19 cm for 352 MHz, 9.5 cm for 704 MHz and 6.5 cm for 1056 MHz)

Folder 'fixed_small_aperture' is the version with smaller pipe aperture. It's the latest version. 

Folder 'before_merge' is for the cooling channel before the bunch merge. I have not finished all the design.
