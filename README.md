Folder 'varying_RF_length' is the previous version in which the RF length varies in each stage. 

Folder 'fixed_RF_length' is the version in which the RF length is fixed for each frequency. (19 cm for 352 MHz, 9.5 cm for 704 MHz and 6.5 cm for 1056 MHz)

Folder 'pre_merge' is the previous version for the part before the bunch merge system.

Folder 'post_merge' is the previous version for the part after the bunch merge system.

Folder '2024-6-14_lattice_files' is the latest version corresponding to a paper in preparation.

Folder '2024-8-12_lattice_files' has different solenoids in B-stage 1 to 4 and RF setting in other B-stages are changed compared to '2024-6-14_lattice_files'. Lattice of the pre-merge does not change.
